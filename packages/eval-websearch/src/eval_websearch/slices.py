"""Slice taxonomy + deterministic assignment + per-slice wins matrix.

Ported from arlenk2021/GoldenEvalsWebSearch `src/slices.py` (the taxonomy +
assignment) and `src/reporting/slices.py` (the per-slice leaderboard + wins
matrix). Tie bands are delegated to `bench_stats.tied_rank_band` (the shared
"name a winner only when its Wilson interval clears the runner-up's" decision),
and per-proportion CIs to `bench_stats.wilson`.

A **slice** is a cross-cutting tag describing a query's intent/domain — orthogonal
to `stratum` (difficulty kind) and `source` (registry). Slices turn one
leaderboard into many: "Exa wins company_lookup", "exa/serpapi tie
government_registry", "Brave wins broad web freshness". A row may carry several
slices.

Slices are part of the frozen row contract: assigned deterministically from the
row's source + metadata (no model, no fetch), so they are reproducible and
auditable. To add a slice, add a source that produces it (see SOURCE_SLICES) or a
content rule below — then re-run the reslice step.
