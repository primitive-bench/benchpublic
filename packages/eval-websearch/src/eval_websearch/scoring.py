"""hit@k set membership + miss taxonomy + sentinel retrievability verdict.

Ported from arlenk2021/GoldenEvalsWebSearch `src/probe/scoring.py`. The liveness
gate itself lives in bench-core (`bench_core.verify.liveness_gate`) and is imported
where the probe needs it; here we keep the search-specific scoring instruments:

  * hit@k as PURE set membership after URL normalization against the row's
    equivalence class — no judge, no human.
  * the web_search MISS TAXONOMY (ranked_below_k / mirror_not_in_class / not_found).
  * the SENTINEL retrievability verdict (the only honest way to split a
    `not_found` miss into not_indexed vs ranked-deeper-than-k).
  * `find_promotions`, the mirror auto-promotion gate.

hit@k is delegated to `bench_stats.hit_at_k` for the canonical metric; a thin
local wrapper preserves the original `(returned_urls, members, ks)` signature used
by the probe so an unanticipated mirror promoted by vendor A counts for the batch.

# ---- web_search miss taxonomy (gap 3) ----------------------------------------
# A miss has distinct causes that must not be conflated (the §4 lesson):
#   ranked_below_k    a correct URL was returned, but below the cutoff k
#   mirror_not_in_class  a returned URL holds the truth token but wasn't yet a
#                     declared member -> auto-promoted; the row was being
#                     mis-scored as a miss (the single biggest correctness risk)
#   not_found         no returned URL (at any returned rank) is correct or holds
#                     the token. CANNOT be split into "not indexed" vs "ranked
#                     deeper than our result depth" WITHOUT the sentinel
#                     retrievability instrument (or a per-vendor direct URL lookup).

# ---- sentinel retrievability verdict -----------------------------------------
# Only sentinel rows can split a `not_found` miss into its two real causes,
# because the bench owns the page and minted a globally-unique truth token. On a
# descriptive miss we issue ONE extra "indexing probe" with the token_in_query
# variant; whether even that navigational query surfaces the canonical URL tells
# us whether the page is in the vendor index at all:
#   ranked_below_k  the page IS indexed (the token query found it) — the
#                   descriptive query merely failed to rank it in top-k.
#   not_indexed     even the unique-token query could not surface it — the vendor
#                   has not crawled/indexed the page yet (true index lag).
