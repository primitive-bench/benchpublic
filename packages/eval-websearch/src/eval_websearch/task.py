"""websearch Task + Scorer — wires golden rows -> probe -> score.

Subclasses bench_core.Task / bench_core.Scorer for the web_search primitive.
The public golden DEV split lives in golden-sets-public/websearch/; the held-out
test split lives only behind the private eval server.

The Scorer maps one vendor's returned URLs (the bench-adapters search result
dict, `{returned_urls, ...}`) for a golden item to a `bench_schemas.ScorerOutput`:
hit@{1,5} set membership against the row's equivalence class, the miss taxonomy
on `output.miss_reason`, and the equivalence-class id. The full async probe
loop (liveness gate, mirror auto-promotion, sentinel verdict) lives in
`eval_websearch.probe`; this Scorer is the synchronous per-item view bench-core's
`run_task` drives.
