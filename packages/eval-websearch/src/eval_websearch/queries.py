"""Query-form construction for the web_search primitive.

Ported from arlenk2021/GoldenEvalsWebSearch `src/probe/queries.py`.

The search analog of the extraction depth stratification. A registry-delta row
tempts you toward a query that *contains* the truth token ("CVE-2026-12345
details") — but that is a navigational lookup every vendor saturates, exactly
like title-zone extraction rows. The honest discriminator is finding the
document from a description that does NOT contain its unique identifier.

Forms (easy -> hard):
  - token_in_query: the identifier appears verbatim (navigational; saturates)
  - descriptive:    natural-language description with the identifier removed
                    (the honest discriminator)
