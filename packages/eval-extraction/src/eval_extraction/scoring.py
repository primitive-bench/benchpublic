"""Token-survival scoring + miss classification for web_extraction.

Ported from arlenk2021/GoldenEvalsWebSearch (src/probe/extract/main.py: the
token_locate / classify_miss logic), re-expressed against the frozen
`bench_schemas.ScorerOutput` contract.

The model: hand a vendor the canonical URL of a golden row; the cell is a HIT iff
the row's `truth_token` survives extraction into the vendor's main content. The
token match is whitespace-normalized substring; Federal Register doc numbers,
CVE IDs, and SEC accession numbers are exact strings.

Miss decomposition is the methodology highlight. A miss is one of:

  * blocked       — the vendor hit an anti-bot / access-wall interstitial.
                    THE GAP WAS ANTI-BOT BLOCKING, NOT FRESHNESS: when Exa scores
                    33% token survival on the Federal Register, it is NOT because
                    the facts went stale — 98/100 of its misses carry a
                    "request access" / "just a moment" / Cloudflare interstitial.
                    That is a DIFFERENT capability gap (bot-blocking) than
                    extracting real content that happened to lack the token, so we
                    classify it separately and surface it on ScorerOutput.miss_reason.
  * truncated     — the token exists on the page but sits past where the vendor's
                    extraction was cut off (depth-conditional survival; see
                    token_locate). FR doc numbers live deep in the body and die
                    under truncation, while CVE IDs live at offset ~0 and survive.
  * token_absent  — real content was extracted, the token simply is not in it.
  * empty         — the vendor returned nothing usable (-> no_coverage upstream).

    Returns one of: 'empty', 'blocked', 'truncated', 'token_absent'.

    The order is deliberate. An anti-bot interstitial is checked FIRST: when a
    vendor is firewalled, the "content" it returns is the block page, and the
    truth token's absence from a block page tells us nothing about extraction
    quality — only about bot-blocking. Conflating the two is the exact mistake the
    miss decomposition exists to prevent (the gap was anti-bot blocking, not
    freshness, and not extraction skill).

    `token_depth` is the offset of the token in the CANONICAL (source-of-truth)
    main content. If the token lives deep in the body on the gold page but the
    vendor returned a non-trivial prefix that simply ends before that depth, the
    miss is `truncated` rather than `token_absent` — depth-conditional survival
    defuses the confound that snippet-only extractors look good on title-token
