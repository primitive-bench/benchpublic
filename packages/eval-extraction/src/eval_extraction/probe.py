"""web_extraction probe.

Ported from arlenk2021/GoldenEvalsWebSearch (src/probe/extract/main.py).

For each golden row, hand the canonical URL to each extraction vendor and score
hit = (truth token survives extraction). Same liveness contract as web_search:
a row whose own gold page no longer carries the token in main content is excluded
batch-wide, never charged to a vendor.

Adapted to the public monorepo: vendors are bench_adapters extraction adapters
(firecrawl, jina, exa_live, tavily_extract, apify), each invoked through the
uniform `Adapter.invoke(item) -> dict` interface (returning `main_text`). Each
scored cell is emitted as a `bench_schemas.ItemResult`. Token match is
whitespace-normalized substring; FR doc numbers / CVE IDs / accession numbers are
exact strings (handled in scoring.token_locate).
