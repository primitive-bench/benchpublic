"""Registry-delta pump orchestrator (goldgen).

Polls one or all authoritative registries (SEC EDGAR, Federal Register, NVD CVE,
GitHub Releases), de-dupes by row_id against rows already seen, and appends
golden Candidate rows to data/candidates/candidates.jsonl. No verification
happens here — that is bench_core.verify's job.
